 ## Exercise - Define a Base Class
 
 - Note: The exercises below are based on a game where a spaceship avoids obstacles in space. The ship is positioned at the bottom of a coordinate system and can only move left and right while obstacles "fall" from top to bottom. Throughout the exercises, you'll create classes to represent different types of spaceships that can be used in the game.
 
 Create a `Spaceship` class with three variable properties: `name`, `health`, and `position`. The default value of `name` should be an empty string and `health` should be 0. `position` will be represented by an `Int` where negative numbers place the ship further to the left and positive numbers place the ship further to the right. The default value of `position` should be 0.

class Spaceship {
    var name: String = ""
    var health = 0
    var position = 0
}
